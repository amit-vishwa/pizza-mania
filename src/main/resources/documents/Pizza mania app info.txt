User types:
1.Internal users -> this can only be created by Admin for app client users from cognito user pool
2.External users -> this can be created by Admin as well as new users can register themselves, after inserting record in db a new user is created in cognito

Users:
1.Admin -> Perform CRUD operations on users i.e. add new users, edit user roles, delete users, search users
2.Manager -> Perform CRUD operations on products i.e. add new products, edit products, delete products, search products, complete pending purchase order post 30mins
3.User -> Perform CRUD operations on purchase_details i.e. add new pending purchase order, search products, cancel pending purchase order within 30mins

Public APIs:
1.CSRF -> an open API is there to generate CSRF token that can be passed to APIs other than GET endpoints
2.Sign-in -> only external registered users can pass username and password in order to generate bearer token to access authenticated APIs
3.Sign-up -> external users can register themselves by providing username and password

Internal users:
- They cannot sign-in, they are provided with postman collection to generate token
- Using that bearer token only they can access authenticated APIs
- Internal users will be Admin and Manager only
